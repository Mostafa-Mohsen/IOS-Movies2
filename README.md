in this project i fetch only the movie data and then fetch its trailers and reviews when user choose a movie to see its details

Pros:
        1-the start up loading time is minimized
        2-infinite scroll of movies the more the user scroll the more movies are being fetched
        
Cons:
        1-if the user opens details of a movie in offline mode and he didn't open it before in online mode there won't be any trailers or reviews
        
Note: in this project i depend on AFNetwork cashing of data and i only save the favourite movies data in realm database
